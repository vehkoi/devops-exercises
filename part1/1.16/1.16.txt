I published frontend example to this address: https://frontend-example-devops.fly.dev/. Dockerfile is same as in ex 1.12

Terminal:
$ cd to root directory of the projectg
$ flyctl launch --now 

$ Creating app in ../material-applications/example-frontend
$ Scanning source code
$ Detected a NodeJS app
$ Choose an app name (leave blank to generate one): frontend-example-devops
-> chose server and all done
